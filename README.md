# WheresCroc
Project for the course Artificial Intelligence at Uppsala University

From assignment description:

*"You are a ranger in Wollomunga national park, in outback Australia. Crocodiles in this park have sensors attached that say where they are and the water conditions (salinity, phosphate and nitrogen levels) of the water the crocodile is current swimming in. The park consists of 40 waterholes, each of which is reachable only from its neighbors. The park has records of the calcium, salinity and alkalinity distributions in each waterhole. The sensor on one crocodile, 'Croc', has broken. It no longer says where he is, however it does still provide water condition readings. You need to find Croc. There are also two Swedish backpackers in the park, wandering around at random visiting waterholes. If they end up in the same waterhole as Croc, they will be eaten. You can move a ranger around the waterhole network and search for Croc at different locations. Your score is the number of moves it takes to find Croc.*

*Your task is to implement a control system to compete on the Whereâ€™s Croc game. You will use hidden Markov models and associated algorithms to work out where Croc is given the sequence of observable variables given to you in the game. Read the runWheresCroc help documentation in the R package for more details. The hidden Markov model will permit you to model the dynamic probabilities of Croc being at different water holes. This is important, but not the only important matter in performing well in the game. You will have to think about what else is important and how you can perform as well as possible."*
